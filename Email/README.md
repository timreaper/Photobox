# Hi Cameron!

This is the code created for the email part of the Photobox assessment. It took roughly
1.5 hours to complete and I did it using:

- Gulp (for running tasks)
- jQuery (for triggering the code on load/resize of page to show desktop or mobile views)
- SCSS (for styling the page)
- Bootstrap (for the CSS framework)
- Normalize (for making all styling more consistent between browsers)
