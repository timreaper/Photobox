# Hi Cameron!

This is the code created for the email part of the Photobox assessment. It took roughly
5.5 hours to complete and I did it using:

- Gulp (for running tasks)
- Handlebars (for templating)
- jQuery (for triggering the template code on load of page, for monitoring hashchange, for validating the registration & for the Bootstrap carouself)
- SCSS (for styling the pages)
- Bootstrap (for the CSS framework & base of carousel styling)
- Normalize (for making all styling more consistent between browsers)
